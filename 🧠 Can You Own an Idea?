# 🧠 Can You Own an Idea?

**Short answer:**  
No — not until it’s expressed in a concrete, original way.

You can’t own an *idea* itself.  
You can only own the **specific form** that idea takes once you write it, draw it, record it, or otherwise fix it in a tangible medium.

## ⚖️ The Core Rule

| Concept | Example | Can You Own It? | Why |
|----------|----------|----------------|-----|
| Pure idea | “A boy discovers he’s a wizard and goes to a magical school.” | ❌ No | Too general — anyone can write that. |
| Specific expression | *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone* (J.K. Rowling) | ✅ Yes | Original story, characters, names, and setting are protected. |
| Genre concept | “A spaceship crew explores the galaxy.” | ❌ No | Common sci-fi premise. |
| Unique execution | *Star Trek* universe, characters, and lore | ✅ Yes | Distinct world and expression. |
| Mechanic concept | “A player levels up by killing monsters.” | ❌ No | Generic game mechanic. |
| Implementation | Your unique art, code, story, item names, UI, etc. | ✅ Yes | Original creative work, fixed in code or media. |

## 🧾 How the Law Divides It

| Type of Protection | What It Covers | Example |
|--------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Copyright** | Literary, artistic, and digital works once fixed in a tangible form. | Books, art, music, software, games. |
| **Trademark** | Source identifiers (names, logos, slogans). | “Pokémon,” Nike swoosh, Coke bottle shape. |
| **Patent** | New, useful, non-obvious inventions or processes. | VR haptic-feedback system, mechanical design, algorithm. |
| **Trade Secret** | Confidential information that gives a business an edge. | Coca-Cola formula, Google ranking algorithm. |

## 🧩 Examples of Public-Domain vs. Protected Expression

| Example | Public-Domain Element | Protected Expression |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Superhero stories | “A person gains powers and fights evil.” | Specific hero designs, names, origin stories. |
| Monster hunting | “A group hunts supernatural creatures.” | *The Witcher* world, Geralt’s character, lore, and dialogue. |
| Magical academy | “Teens learn spells at a school.” | Hogwarts, professors, spells, and narrative arcs. |
| Game mechanics | “Gain XP and level up.” | Your code, art assets, UI, and specific system balance. |

## 🛡️ How to “Own” Your Work in Practice

1. **Fix it in a tangible form.**  
   - Write it down, draw it, record it, or code it.  
2. **Keep proof of creation.**  
   - Save drafts, timestamps, emails, commits, or witnesses.  
3. **Register it** (optional but helpful).  
   - In the U.S., register with the Copyright Office or apply for a patent/trademark as needed.  
4. **Use a license** if you publish it.  
   - MIT, Creative Commons, or custom license to define how others can use it.

## 💬 Common Myths

| Myth | Reality |
|------|----------|
| “If I thought of it first, it’s mine.” | No — only the fixed, original expression is protected. |
| “I mailed it to myself, so I’m covered.” | The “poor man’s copyright” has **no legal standing**. |
| “Changing a few words makes it legal.” | Derivative works can still infringe. |
| “If it’s online, it’s public domain.” | Copyright applies the moment it’s created, even online. |
